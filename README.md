NeuroEx
=======

Software package to facilitate objective measurement of the traditional neurological exam.  It's main novelty is is ability to utilize and coordinate multiple sensors including the Wiimote, Wii Fit, AccuSway Plus, and custom limb and trunk sensors (currently in development).

The sensor coordination happens via .net threading and high-resolution .net timers.  The data are saved in XML and custom analytics are used to different groups of patients based on their overall neurological measurement.  Currently the analysis and catagorization code is in very early development and relies on simple R scripts.
